- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database + Authentication + Storage)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (seamless Next.js deployment) or Netlify
- **Image Processing**: Supabase Storage with automatic optimization

### Database Schema (MVP)

```sql
-- clothing_items table
CREATE TABLE clothing_items (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  child_id UUID -- Future: references children table
);

-- Index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_clothing_items_user_id ON clothing_items(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_clothing_items_created_at ON clothing_items(created_at DESC);
```

### API Endpoints (Supabase Auto-Generated)
- `GET /clothing_items` - Retrieve all items for user
- `POST /clothing_items` - Create new clothing item
- `PUT /clothing_items/:id` - Update existing item
- `DELETE /clothing_items/:id` - Remove item
- `POST /storage/images` - Upload image file

## User Interface Requirements

### Design Principles
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly interfaces, large tap targets
- **Visual Priority**: Photos are the primary content, text is secondary
- **Simple Navigation**: Minimal menu structure, intuitive flow
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized images, progressive loading

### Key Screens

1. **Home/Inventory View**
   - Grid of clothing items (2-3 columns on phone, 3-4 on tablet)
   - Large photo thumbnails
   - Item names below photos
   - Floating "Add Item" button
   - Search bar at top

2. **Add Item Screen**

- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (secondary consideration)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Development (2-4 weeks)
1. **Week 1**: Project setup, Supabase configuration, basic UI framework
2. **Week 2**: Image upload functionality, database integration
3. **Week 3**: Inventory view, responsive design implementation
4. **Week 4**: Testing, PWA optimization, deployment

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Future)
- Multiple children support
- Advanced filtering and categorization
- Outfit planning features

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- User can successfully add clothing items with photos
- App loads and functions properly on target devices
- Image upload and storage works reliably
- Inventory view displays items clearly and quickly
- No critical bugs in core functionality

### Future KPIs
- Daily/weekly active users
- Number of items added per user
- User retention rate
- Feature adoption rates

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Image upload reliability**: Mitigation through robust error handling
- **Mobile performance**: Address through image optimization and lazy loading
- **Data loss**: Prevented by Supabase's built-in backup systems

### User Adoption Risks
- **Complexity**: Mitigated by focusing on simplicity in MVP
- **Value proposition**: Regular user feedback and iterative improvements

## Launch Strategy

### MVP Launch

2. Feedback collection and critical bug fixes
3. Soft launch for close family/friends
4. Iterative improvements based on real usage

### Post-Launch
- Monitor user behavior and feedback
