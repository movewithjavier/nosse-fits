## 🚀 Current Features

### Core Functionality
- **Item Upload**: Camera/gallery photo upload with image compression
- **Wardrobe View**: Grid display of all clothing items

- **Mobile-Friendly**: Edit buttons always visible (no hover-only)

### Upload System
- **Dual Input**: Separate "Take Photo" and "Choose from Gallery" buttons
- **Image Compression**: Automatic optimization to reduce file sizes
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with status indicators
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and user feedback

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **D3.js** for network graph visualization

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth)
- **Personal Use Mode**: No user authentication required
- **RLS Policies**: Super permissive for single-user access

## 🐛 Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G + DuckDuckGo Compatibility ✅
**Problem**: Wife's device couldn't upload photos, failed after first attempt
**Root Causes**:
- Canvas API restrictions in privacy-focused browsers
- Memory leaks after image compression
- Supabase connection state corruption

**Solutions**:
- Browser detection and fallback handling
- Complete resource cleanup (Canvas, Image, ObjectURL)
- Fresh Supabase client per upload attempt
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging

### 2. Rate Limiting & Upload Throttling ✅
**Problem**: Third upload consistently failed with "network connection issue"
**Root Cause**: Supabase Storage API rate limiting (~2 request burst limit)

**Solutions**:
- Intelligent rate limiting (2-second minimum intervals)
- Progressive backoff for multiple uploads
- Upload count tracking with escalating delays
- Enhanced retry logic for network/throttling errors

### 3. Accidental Item Deletion ✅
**Problem**: Red X delete button in wardrobe view caused accidents
**Solution**: Removed delete button from ItemCard - users must enter item detail view to delete

### 4. Mobile Edit UX Issues ✅
**Problem**: Hover-only edit buttons invisible on mobile/iPad
**Solution**: Made edit buttons always visible while maintaining hover effects

## 📊 Upload System Details

### Rate Limiting Implementation
```javascript
// Global tracking
let lastUploadTime = 0
const MIN_UPLOAD_INTERVAL = 2000 // 2 seconds
let uploadCount = 0

// Progressive delays for multiple uploads
if (uploadCount > 2) {
  const progressiveDelay = Math.min((uploadCount - 2) * 1000, 5000)
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, progressiveDelay))
}
```

### Browser Compatibility
- **DuckDuckGo Detection**: Special handling for privacy restrictions
- **Canvas Fallback**: Use original file if compression fails
- **Memory Management**: Complete cleanup prevents subsequent failures

### Retry Logic
- **3 attempts** with exponential backoff
- **Network error detection** with extended delays
- **Fresh client creation** prevents connection corruption

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### Tables
- **clothing_items**: Main item storage (id, name, description, image_url, image_path, created_at, updated_at)
- **item_matches**: Relationships between items (item_id, matches_with_id)
- **item_matches_view**: Materialized view for efficient matching queries

### Storage
- **clothing-images bucket**: Supabase Storage for photos
- **Auto-generated filenames**: Timestamp + random + sanitized name
- **10MB file limit**: With compression, most images under 1MB
